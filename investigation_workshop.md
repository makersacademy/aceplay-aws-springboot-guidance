## Investigation Exercises

<!-- OMITTED -->

For diagrams, use something other people can see and refer to rather than a bit
of paper. For example, [draw.io](https://draw.io/) or
[miro.com](https://miro.com/).

## Track A

### Challenge 1

Use `curl` or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to:

* Sign up with a new account
* Create a new playlist
* Retrieve that playlist

The [demo of the JSON API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ1avb8s61c&t=805s)
may help you here.

### Challenge 2

Create a diagram of what happens when the user creates a new playlist.

### Challenge 3

Create a diagram of what happens when the user adds a track to a playlist.

### Challenge 4

_Note: You won't actually add this to the deployed application — this is just for
investigation purposes._

Make a change to the app so that:

* Playlists have a new field on it called 'cool'.
* The app can create playlists with `cool` set to true or false.
* The app responds to `GET /api/playlists/cool` with a list of only the cool
  playlists.
* The app responds to `GET /api/playlists/uncool` with a list of only the uncool
  playlists.

Make sure to test all of this too!

## Track B

### Challenge 1

Use `curl` or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to:

* Sign up with a new account
* Create a new track
* Retrieve a list of all tracks

The [demo of the JSON API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ1avb8s61c&t=805s)
may help you here.

### Challenge 2

Create a diagram of what happens when the user creates a new track.

### Challenge 3

Create a diagram of what happens when the user adds a track to a playlist.

### Challenge 4

_Note: You won't actually add this to the deployed application — this is just for
investigation purposes._

Make a change to the app so that:

* Tracks have a new field on it called 'cool'.
* The app can create tracks with `cool` set to true or false.
* The app responds to `GET /api/tracks/cool` with a list of only the cool
  tracks.
* The app responds to `GET /api/tracks/uncool` with a list of only the uncool
  tracks.

Make sure to test all of this too!
